I'm a software engineer based in Bucharest, Romania. I've got about 4 years worth of work experience, mostly focusing on web technologies. I've enjoyed wearing different hats and performing different roles, ranging from frontend to backend development. I enjoy learning about the intricacies and motivations of software systems. I've also been told I enjoy talking too much about some things.

I've got an ever-growing list of things to learn and would like share my experiences with you through this blog. Most recently I've been focused on the awesome and convoluted worlds of distributed systems and cloud computing. Posts may appear disorderly while I explore different avenues, but I think there's real value in letting your explorations guide you to new things, so I invite you to enjoy this journey through software with me.
